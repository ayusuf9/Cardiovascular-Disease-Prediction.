# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction with Random Forest
This project explores cardiovascular disease data through visualizations using Seaborn and predicts disease risk using a Scikit-learn random forest classifier, considering diverse risk factors.

# Project Description
The goal is to create a reliable and efficient cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction model using the random forest algorithm. Data exploration insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib visualizations, along with data preprocessing capabilities from the Scikit-learn library, contribute to building an accurate risk assessment model.

This project takes a structured, end-to-end machine learning approach, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Gain insights into the dataset through visual exploration of cardiovascular risk factors using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Data Preprocessing: Apply Scikit-learn preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for modeling, such as standardization, encoding categorical variables, etc.
- Model Training: Build a random forest classifier model on the preprocessed data to predict CVD risk.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. through cross-validation.
- Insight Generation: Interpret model results and their potential real-world implications for healthcare and preventative medicine.
  
Robust CVD risk predictions from this model could assist medical professionals in making more informed patient care and disease prevention decisions.
